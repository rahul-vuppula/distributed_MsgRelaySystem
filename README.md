# distributed_MsgRelaySystem
Communication between computers over a network using socket.
Here we have pre defined sender and receiver credentials in a text file.
When sender login and send the message then it will sent to the relay server and later to receiver.
Receiver will compute the message to get most repeated word from the message and display the answer on the sender side.
